# Repository

## what is the Repository

A repository is like a folder for your project. Your project's repository contains all of your project's files and stores each file's revision history. You can also discuss and manage your project's work within the repository.

For user-owned repositories, you can give other people collaborator access so that they can collaborate on your project. If a repository is owned by an organization, you can give organization members access permissions to collaborate on your repository.

Each person and organization can own unlimited public repositories and invite an unlimited number of collaborators to public repositories. With GitHub Free, you can use unlimited free private repositories with a limited feature set and add up to three other people as repository collaborators. To get unlimited private repositories with unlimited collaborators, you can upgrade to GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, or GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

You can collaborate on your project with others using your repository's issues, pull requests, and project boards.
