The primary branch (the Master branch created by default) is only used to distribute major releases (different labels can be created for each release for easy lookup);Daily development should be done on another branch, which you can call Develop;Temporary branch, use up after the best delete, so as not to branch chaos.Such as:
When multiple people are working on a feature branch, each person may assign a branch that is his or her own, and the branch should be merged into the superior branch when the phased work is completed.
