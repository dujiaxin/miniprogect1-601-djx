## why learning git and commands
**git** plays important role in version control, helping you to manage your work (sometimes your team work) works nicely.
**commands line** is important because you need to learn linux. Linux is heavily used in servers (web developmend) and machien learning, so if you want to do something related to this field, you'd better learn them.

## why continues integration important

*written by Jiaxin Du*

I used to do a project with 7 people for 2 years (it's not a big team but a long working time). We used git and gitlab in developing our website.

In the begining I have no idea about git, and I totally messed up our team. I submitted bugs to the repo and everyone is mad at me. Then I realized the importance of learning git, actually I need to learn how to do continues integration.

While I was reading [Martin Fowler's blog](#https://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html), it suddenly bring me back to old time. Here is his tips, I found it's exactly what I learned or should do in the past.
-	Maintain a Single Source Repository.
-	Automate the Build
-	Make Your Build Self-Testing
-	Everyone Commits To the Mainline Every Day
-	Every Commit Should Build the Mainline on an Integration Machine
-	Fix Broken Builds Immediately
-	Keep the Build Fast
-	Test in a Clone of the Production Environment
-	Make it Easy for Anyone to Get the Latest Executable
-	Everyone can see what's happening
-	Automate Deployment
