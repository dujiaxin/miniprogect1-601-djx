# Commit

Similar to saving a file, a commit is a change to one or more files in your branch. Git assigns each commit a unique ID, called a SHA or hash, that tracks:

* The specific changes
* When the changes were made
* Who created the changes

When you make a commit, you must include a commit message that briefly describes the changes. You can also add a co-author on any commits you collaborate on.

    git commit -m "commit message"

For example
