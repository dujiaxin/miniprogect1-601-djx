# Clone

When you create a repository on GitHub, it exists as a remote repository. You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between the two locations.

This procedure assumes you have already created a repository on GitHub, or have an existing repository owned by someone else you'd like to contribute to.

* On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.

* Under the repository name,click Clone or download.
